If you are reading this, you likely have experience using Excel. Your experience may be using it to track a few personal finance items, or you may have built an entire career working in Excel daily to manage the accounting or supply chain of a prominent business. If for no other reason, this makes building software and automation tools utilizing the highly flexible capabilities of Excel a great option. Jump to Project Examples Reasons to use Excel for your solution User-friendly - Even highly complex customized Excel tools have a familiarity for nearly all users. Cost-Effective - The primary spreadsheet interface gives a great starting point for the data handling needs of most business processes. This benefit can significantly speed up the time it takes to build a solution than creating a user-interface from scratch. Schedule Effective - In addition to being faster to develop, the user-friendly nature will reduce the typical friction in training and transitioning to new processes for users. Deployment can often be as easy as sharing an Excel file. Capability \u2013 Excel Macros are written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). VBA is a general-purpose programming language that can automate Excel and most of your entire PC due to its' seamless interactions with Windows (and other Microsoft products). In contrast, many low-code platforms such as Power Automate, Power Apps, etc., may hit a low ceiling on their capabilities. Even other general-purpose programming languages (python, java, etc.) may require additional effort to work well with Windows and your PC. Due to its' qualities described above, it can be magnitudes quicker to create, test, and deploy a solution. A more hidden benefit of this is that you can quickly trial a process change, and if you don't like it, it is easier to let go and try something else. The other standard software options of commissioning a built-from-scratch application or purchasing an expensive new subscription can make the business over-invested in a solution. This situation means you may have used up significant time and resources before you realize the solution is not for you, and it can be hard to let go of the sunken effort. When you may not want to use Excel for your solution Especially complex data analysis may be better suited for specialized tools such as Python or R. An extreme example would be Machine Learning. In some other cases, Excel may have the ability to perform the task but be much less effective or efficient. Power BI or similar software may be better suited for complex data dashboards with vast data (ex. more than 1 million rows). If you need a web app or browser-based solution. Applications that run through your web browser may be better for particular goals. Macros and VBA cannot run through a browser yet, although Excel Online is constantly increasing in capability and can be a great solution in some cases. If you cannot tolerate any deviation from a strict process. The flexibility of Excel means that users will always have a certain degree of freedom. There are ways to reduce risk, such as protecting aspects of the file, restricting access, etc. However, it will always have much more user flexibility than a built-from-scratch application.
